We spend a lot of time working on our [free developer services](https://beyondco.de/services) or open source packages. You can support our work by [buying one of our paid products](https://beyondco.de/software).

## Development

If you want to create your own build of TailwindCSS JIT CDN, you can fork this repo, clone it, and then run the following commands to get started:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
```

Then, link to your new `dist/tailwindcss-jit-cdn.umd.js` in your project in order to run your build.

## Options

A set of `tailwindOptions` to configure for the JIT CDN. Currently there is only one option available, you can use it as follows:

```
window.options = {
    observerElement: document.getElementById('app')
};
```

> By default the TailwindCSS JIT CDN will observe your entire page via `document.documentElement`, you can override this option via the `observerElement` property. In the options above the observer will only observe Tailwind classes inside of `app` element. This might be helpful for page speed, user experience, or a few other scenarios.

ðŸ’¡ Have ideas for options you would like to see, let us know.
